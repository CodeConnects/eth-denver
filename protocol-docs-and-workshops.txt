Polygon
  zkEVM launching March 27. Tech lead of the project was not fully confident in launch date
  He also was a bit worried about future hacks. Kept mentioning that there is no warranty for devs using it
  It will be centralized at first on the Prover side, which seems to be the main attack vector
  A corrupt Prover could prove a bad transaction, and then others would validate their zk proof as good
